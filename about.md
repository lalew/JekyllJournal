This site was created to help me organize and sort through all the technologies I'm using daily. Also, in here will be projects I have implemented before and currently to improve my skills as a Software Engineer. In addition, it serves as a general documentation page where I can re-find many solutions to problems I've had before, as most problems are more similar to each other than imagined.

### About the Author

My name is Lawrence Lew. I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego, pursuing a path towards becoming a Software Engineer. I'm always trying to learn new technologies to put into my toolbelt and have a lot of fun seeing where and how I can use them. This site is just one place where I got organize my thoughts on different tools.
